            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In August 1946, the U.S. Navy launched the largest Antarctic expedition in history. Operation Highjump 
                included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. The official mission: "scientific research" and 
                "establishing the Antarctic research base Little America IV."

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The expedition was planned to last 6-8 months. It was aborted after just 8 weeks.

                    unduly but that it was a bitter reality that in case of a new war the continental

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The official Navy report claimed the mission was a complete success. But mission logs show multiple
