            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                According to official naval records, the USS Eldridge (DE-173) was a routine destroyer escort commissioned 
                in 1943. According to witnesses, it was the centerpiece of the most classified experiment in human history—an 
                attempt to achieve electromagnetic invisibility that instead opened doorways through space and time itself.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The experiment allegedly stemmed from Einstein's Unified Field Theory research, weaponized by the Navy to 
                create ships invisible to enemy radar and visual detection. What they got instead was a vessel that could 
                phase in and out of our reality, teleport instantaneously across hundreds of miles, and trap its crew 
                between dimensions.

            </h2>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The theoretical foundation came from Einstein's work on electromagnetic field manipulation. By generating 
                powerful rotating magnetic fields around the ship's hull, researchers believed they could bend light 
                around the vessel, rendering it invisible.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The equipment allegedly included massive Tesla coils, high-frequency generators, and a network of cables 
                wrapped around the ship's hull in precise mathematical patterns. When activated, these systems would 
                create a electromagnetic "bubble" around the Eldridge.

                The Navy's response to these allegations has been consistent and suspicious: complete denial coupled with 
                the classification of all related documents. They claim the Eldridge was never even in Philadelphia 
                during the alleged experiment dates—yet provide no alternative location records.

                More telling is what happened to the witnesses. Carlos Allende was discredited as a "crackpot," despite 
                his detailed technical knowledge and consistent testimony over decades. Crew members who attempted to 
                speak publicly were either transferred to remote postings or declared mentally unfit for service.

                Recent developments in quantum physics, particularly research into the relationship between consciousness
