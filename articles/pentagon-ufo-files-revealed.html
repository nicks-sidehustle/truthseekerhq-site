            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For decades, asking "what UFO files?" was the government's standard response. Now, with Trump ordering disclosure, the question has become "which files first?" The answer reveals a hidden infrastructure of UFO investigation that's been operating in the shadows longer than most Americans have been alive.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                We've been tracking government UFO programs for years, piecing together the classified architecture from whistleblower testimonies, leaked documents, and FOIA releases. Here's what actually exists—and what we might finally see.
            </p>

            <!-- AATIP: The $22 Million Question -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-500 mt-12 mb-6"><i class="fas fa-search mr-2"></i>AATIP: The $22 Million Secret</h2>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program is where modern UFO disclosure began. From 2007 to 2012, the Pentagon spent $22 million studying what they called "anomalous aerial vehicles." Senator Harry Reid secured the funding. Defense Intelligence Agency contractor Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies did the research. Luis Elizondo ran the program.
            </p>

            <div class="program-box pl-6 py-4 my-8">
                <h4 class="font-bold text-blue-400 mb-3">AATIP BY THE NUMBERS</h4>
                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                    <li><strong>$22 million:</strong> Total program budget over 5 years</li>
                    <li><strong>38 research papers:</strong> Scientific analysis of UAP technology</li>
                    <li><strong>12 contractors:</strong> Aerospace companies involved in research</li>
                    <li><strong>144 incidents:</strong> Officially catalogued encounters</li>
                    <li><strong>3 videos released:</strong> "FLIR1", "Gimbal", "GoFast"</li>
                    <li><strong>Thousands more:</strong> Videos still classified</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What made AATIP different wasn't just the money—it was the scientific rigor. This wasn't Project Blue Book's "explain it away" mentality. AATIP researchers were tasked with reverse-engineering technology that shouldn't exist.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The 38 research papers AATIP commissioned read like science fiction made real: "Warp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions." "Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy." "Invisibility Cloaking." The Pentagon was seriously studying technology that makes our most advanced aircraft look like Wright Flyer replicas.
            </p>

            <!-- The Navy Videos: Just the Beginning -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-500 mt-12 mb-6"><i class="fas fa-video mr-2"></i>The Navy Videos: Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h2>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The three Navy UFO videos released in 2020 changed everything. "FLIR1," "Gimbal," and "GoFast" showed military-grade sensors tracking objects performing maneuvers that defy known physics. But according to multiple sources, these three videos represent less than 1% of what exists in classified Navy archives.

                Commander David Fravor, who encountered the "Tic-Tac" object in 2004, has confirmed that much longer, much clearer footage exists. "What they released was like showing someone a single frame from a movie and asking them to understand the plot," Fravor said in 2022.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In 2022, the Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to replace AATIP's informal structure with a formal, funded investigation program. AARO's mission: collect, analyze, and identify UAPs across all domains—air, space, land, sea, and cyber.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                AARO's database currently contains over 800 unexplained encounters reported since 2021. But this represents only military reports with sensor data confirmation. The actual number of UAP encounters, including civilian and foreign military sightings, is estimated to be 10 times higher.

                AATIP and AARO represent the modern era of UFO investigation. But the classified files stretch back to 1947, starting with the Roswell incident and continuing through decades of secret military programs most Americans have never heard of.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Project Blue Book (1952-1969)</strong> was the public face of UFO investigation. But running parallel were classified programs with names like Project Grudge, Project Sign, and operations so secret they're still known only by code numbers.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                UFOs don't respect national borders, and neither does the investigation. Intelligence sharing agreements with the UK, Canada, Australia, and other allies have created a global UFO database that few realize exists.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The UK's Ministry of Defence released over 60,000 pages of UFO files between 2008-2013. France's GEIPAN program publishes UFO investigations online. But the U.S.-UK intelligence partnership, formalized in the UKUSA Agreement, has kept the most sensitive encounters classified under "special relationship" protocols.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The real story won't be in what gets released—it'll be in what gets redacted. When entire pages are blacked out, when video timestamps jump mysteriously, when scientific analysis sections are completely removed, that's where the truth lives.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Pay attention to the metadata. File creation dates, classification levels, distribution lists. The Pentagon can redact content, but they can't hide the infrastructure of secrecy itself.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Perhaps the biggest impact of disclosure won't be political—it'll be scientific. For decades, studying UFOs was career suicide for serious researchers. Now, with official Pentagon confirmation that "anomalous aerial phenomena" exist and display technology beyond current understanding, mainstream science can finally engage.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Universities are already establishing UAP research programs. The Galileo Project at Harvard is building a network of sensors specifically designed to detect and analyze anomalous objects. NASA has committed to UAP investigation. The stigma is lifting, and the data is becoming available.

                <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg mb-4">
                    The Pentagon's UFO files contain 75 years of the most carefully guarded secrets in American history. We're about to see more than ever before—but not everything. The real question isn't whether UFOs exist. The real question is: what has our government learned from studying them, and why have they kept it secret for so long?

                <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
                    The files exist. The materials are real. The encounters are documented. Now we find out how much of the truth they're finally willing to share.
