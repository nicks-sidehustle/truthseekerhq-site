                In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the NSA's mass surveillance programs: PRISM, XKeyscore, Tempora. 
                The government was collecting everything — emails, phone calls, internet activity — from everyone.

                Then we went back to installing listening devices in our bedrooms. We gave them cute names. 
                We asked them to play music and set timers. We forgot that they were listening to everything else too.

                But here's the truth: in 2026, complete digital privacy is impossible without complete digital 
                withdrawal. The system is designed to make surveillance the default.

                The Stasi had to recruit informants. They had to bug apartments manually. They had to store

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Jeremy Bentham designed the Panopticon in 1791 — a prison where inmates could be watched at any time 
                without knowing when they were being watched. The point wasn't constant surveillance. 
                The point was the <em>possibility</em> of surveillance.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When you might be watched at any moment, you police yourself. You modify your behavior. 
                You become your own prison guard.

                How often do you pause before typing a search? Rephrase a text message? Avoid saying something 
                aloud because your phone is nearby? We've internalized the surveillance. The Panopticon isn't 
                a building anymore — it's everywhere.
