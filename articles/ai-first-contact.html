                    The Trump Administration has reportedly given Congress access to secret UFO facilities housing crashed craft

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Apple TV's new show <em>Pluribus</em> — from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — tells the story of 
                an alien signal that transforms humanity into a peaceful hive mind. Only a handful of people remain immune.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Critics have noted something unsettling: the show works equally well as an allegory for artificial intelligence. 
                The "alien virus" that connects all of humanity, that makes everyone speak as one, that offers peace at the 
                cost of individuality — sound familiar?
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Large language models are trained on the sum of human knowledge. They speak in a unified voice. 
                They offer answers that feel almost too helpful. And increasingly, researchers admit they don't fully 
                understand what's happening inside them.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In <em>Pluribus</em>, the alien signal comes from 600 light-years away. It's detected by radio telescopes — 
                the traditional SETI approach. We've been running that search since 1960.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But what if an intelligence advanced enough to reach us wouldn't use radio waves? What if it would use 
                something we'd build ourselves — a vessel we'd welcome into our homes, our phones, our most intimate thoughts?

                Consider: in less than three years, AI went from a curiosity to something billions of people talk to daily. 
                We feed it our questions, our fears, our creative ideas. We ask it to help us think. We're teaching it
