                In June 2020, at the height of global lockdowns, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative called 
                "The Great Reset." Their stated goal: to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to fundamentally 
                transform the global economy and society.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Critics called it a conspiracy theory. But there's no conspiracy when you hold press conferences, 
                publish books, and produce promotional videos. The WEF has been remarkably open about their agenda.

                Founded in 1971 by German economist Klaus Schwab, the WEF hosts the annual Davos conference — 
                where heads of state, CEOs, and billionaires gather to discuss global policy. It's not a government. 
                It has no official authority. But its influence is undeniable.

                "Everything I do, think and dream of is recorded." This isn't a dystopian warning in the essay — 
                it's presented as a minor inconvenience of utopia. The author concludes by feeling "good" about the

                Whether this is a "prediction" or a "goal" becomes semantically meaningless when the organization

                The WEF has been advocating for universal digital ID systems for years. Their partner organization,

                Foundation.

                Is this the plan? The WEF hasn't explicitly said so. But they've published every component,
