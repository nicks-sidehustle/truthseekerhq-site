            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Operation Paperclip began before World War II even ended. As Allied forces advanced through Germany, 
                special intelligence teams weren't just looking for weapons—they were hunting for the scientists who 
                created them. The mission was simple: capture Nazi technology and the minds behind it before the 
                Soviets could.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                What emerged was the largest covert relocation of scientific personnel in history. Werner von Braun, 
                who used slave labor to build V-2 rockets that killed thousands in London, became the celebrated 
                director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. His team of former SS officers designed the Saturn V 
                that put Americans on the moon.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                But von Braun was just the public face. Hundreds of other Nazi scientists disappeared into America's 
                black projects, working on technologies that remain classified eight decades later.

                Among the most disturbing discoveries was evidence of Die Glocke—"The Bell"—a mysterious device 
                developed in the underground laboratories of Nazi Germany. Witnesses described a metallic bell-shaped 
                object that generated powerful electromagnetic fields and exhibited antigravity properties.

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                SS-Oberführer Hans Kammler, who oversaw the project, disappeared at the war's end along with the Bell 
                and its research team. American intelligence files suggest both made their way to the United States 
                under Paperclip protocols, forming the foundation for decades of classified propulsion research.

                Operation Paperclip represents one of the most morally compromised decisions in American history. 
                In the name of national security and technological advancement, the United States gave safe haven 
                to war criminals, allowing them to continue their research without accountability for their crimes.

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The program's legacy raises uncomfortable questions about the price of technological progress and 
                the origins of America's aerospace supremacy. How much of our modern technological capability was 
                built on the work of Nazi scientists? How many breakthroughs came at the cost of moral compromise?

            <p class="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Most troubling of all: if technologies like Die Glocke were successfully developed and remain hidden 
                in classified programs, what other capabilities exist beyond public knowledge? Operation Paperclip 
                didn't just import Nazi scientists—it may have imported their most dangerous discoveries, technologies 
                that continue to shape our world from the shadows.
