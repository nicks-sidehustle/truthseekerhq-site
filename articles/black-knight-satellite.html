            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                In 1899—decades before humanity launched its first satellite—amateur radio operator Nikola Tesla detected 
                structured signals from space during his experiments in Colorado Springs. The signals followed mathematical 
                patterns that suggested artificial origin, but Tesla's reports were dismissed as interference or natural phenomena.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                In 1927, Norwegian engineer Jørgen Hals detected radio echoes with unexplained delays—some returning 
                3-15 seconds after transmission, far longer than any earthbound reflection could explain. These "Long 
                Delayed Echoes" (LDEs) suggested something in distant orbit was receiving and retransmitting Earth's signals.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                But it was in 1960, during the height of the Space Race, that the object gained its infamous name. 
                Both American and Soviet tracking stations detected a dark, tumbling object in polar orbit—an orbit no 
                country claimed responsibility for launching.

                In 1973, Scottish researcher Duncan Lunan made a breakthrough that sent shockwaves through the scientific 
                community. By plotting the delay patterns of Long Delayed Echoes detected since the 1920s, he discovered 
                they formed a recognizable pattern—a star map of the constellation Boötes as it would have appeared 
                13,000 years ago.

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The map included what appeared to be a message: "START HERE. OUR HOME IS UPSILON BOÖTES, WHICH IS A 
                DOUBLE STAR. WE LIVE ON THE SIXTH PLANET OF SEVEN—CHECK THAT, THE SIXTH OF SEVEN—COUNTING OUTWARD FROM

                Perhaps most disturbing is evidence that ancient civilizations were aware of the Black Knight. Sumerian 
                texts reference "the watcher who does not sleep," describing an object that moves across the sky in 
                patterns unlike the sun, moon, or planets.

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Mayan astronomical records include references to a "dark star" that returns in cycles, observing but 
                never descending. Hindu texts describe Narada, a sage who travels between worlds and "dwells among 
                the stars," matching the orbital characteristics of an observation satellite.

                In December 1998, the crew of Space Shuttle mission STS-88 captured several photographs of a dark, 
                irregularly shaped object in Earth's orbit. NASA initially classified these images, then later released 
                them with the explanation that they showed "space debris from a thermal blanket."

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                However, analysis of the photographs reveals an object with non-random geometry and surface features 
                inconsistent with debris. The object appears deliberately constructed, with what could be antennae or 
                sensor arrays extending from its main body.

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The Black Knight's orbital characteristics present problems for conventional explanations. Its polar 
                orbit requires significantly more energy to achieve than equatorial orbits—an inefficient choice for 
                debris but perfect for comprehensive Earth observation.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                More puzzling is its apparent stability. Objects in similar orbits typically decay within decades due 
                to atmospheric drag, yet the Black Knight has maintained its position for over 60 years of confirmed 
                observation—and possibly much longer.
